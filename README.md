**ABOUT**

Our mission is to create a tool that scans a network and analyizes the output through visulaizations. 

#### SD1-P1.py
Our first goal was making a network scanner using NMAP python library, parsing the results, and creating a JSON file with the collected network information in order for it to be used in our database.

#### SD1-P2.py
Our second goal was using our raw network data to sort and create entries, nodes, and edges for the graph construction. Here is a link to our thought process of the graph construction. (Note: Relationship entity model)

#### SD1-P3.py
Our third goal was to actually construct the graph using our EDGES collection from our database. This graph is very crucial since it will be needed to implemented graph embedding functions/techniques through the GEM Library. We are mostly using SDNE and node2vec. 

Here is a link to the GEM Library repo.
